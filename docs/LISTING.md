## Description (Full)

### ⚡ Test Management Without the Complexity

**Quick Test Cases for Jira** lets you track test status on any Jira issue with a single click. No training required, no enterprise setup, no per-user fees eating into your budget.

### ✨ Key Features

- **🎯 One-Click Status** - Mark any issue as Passed ✓, Failed ✗, Blocked, or In Progress
- **📝 Test Notes** - Add observations and findings with auto-save
- **📋 Run History** - See the last 10 test runs with timestamps
- **🔄 Quick Reset** - Clear status and start fresh anytime
- **☁️ Cloud Synced** - Access from any device

### 💡 Perfect For

- **Small QA teams** - Track tests without enterprise pricing
- **Developers testing their own code** - Quick validation before PR
- **Manual testing** - Simple pass/fail tracking during exploratory testing
- **Sprint testing** - Track which stories have been tested
- **Acceptance testing** - Mark user stories as accepted or rejected

### 🛡️ Privacy First

All data is stored securely in Atlassian's Forge platform. We cannot access your test data, and neither can anyone outside your Jira instance.

### 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install the app
2. Open any Jira issue
3. Find "Quick Test Cases" in the right sidebar
4. Click Pass, Fail, or Blocked - done!

### 💰 Why Pay $15/user for Enterprise Tools?

Enterprise test management tools like Zephyr and Xray are powerful but overkill for many teams. If you just need simple status tracking:
- ❌ Don't need test suites
- ❌ Don't need test cycles
- ❌ Don't need complex reporting
- ✅ Just need Pass/Fail/Blocked

**Quick Test Cases** is your answer.
